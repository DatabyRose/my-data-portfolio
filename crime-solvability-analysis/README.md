# Crime Data Analysis: Predicting Case Solvability

### Course Project | Python for Data Analytics | University of Niagara Falls

> **Author:** Rosario Torres  
> **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

---

## Overview

An end-to-end data analysis and modeling project exploring crime trends and case solvability‚Äîdeveloped as part of my Master‚Äôs coursework at UNF. This project explores a crime dataset (similar to the SF Crime Dataset) to uncover patterns in crime types, demographics, and case outcomes. The goal was to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts whether a case is likely to be **solved or unsolved** based on available features.

---

## Purpose

- Practice **data cleaning**, **EDA**, and **machine learning modeling** on a real-world-like dataset
- Identify **patterns in case solvability** across location, age, gender, ethnicity, and crime type
- Build classification models to predict the likelihood of a case being solved
- Reflect on social and ethical considerations in analyzing crime and demographic data

---

## Process

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values
- Merged rare ethnicity values into common categories
- Ensured consistent formats for gender, location, and date fields

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Crime trends across **age groups**, **gender**, and **ethnicity**
- Spatial distribution of **unsolved cases by location**
- Temporal analysis: frequency by year and month
- Correlation matrix for numeric variables

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Extracted features from timestamps (year, month)
- One-hot encoding for categorical features
- Binarized target variable: `Solved` vs. `Unsolved`

### 4. Predictive Modeling
Five models were trained and compared:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
- XGBoost (Untuned)  
- XGBoost (Tuned)

**Metrics Used**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC  
**Class Imbalance**: ~22.5% solved vs. ~77.5% unsolved  
*Note: No resampling or class weighting applied in this version.*

| XGBoost (Tuned)     | 83.56%   | 65.50%             | **46.28%**       | **54.24%**| 0.85 |

**Best Overall**: Tuned XGBoost  
**Best Recall**: Logistic Regression  
**Most Balanced**: Tuned XGBoost (Precision + Recall + AUC)

## üîç Key Insights

- **Weapon usage**, **premise type**, and **modus operandi count** were strong predictors of solvability  
- **Location** and **crime type** influenced resolution rates significantly  
- **Daytime crimes** had higher solve rates, likely due to witness availability  
- **Demographics** had modest impact; age group mattered more than gender or ethnicity

## Recommended Visuals to Showcase

Below are key visualizations featured in the notebook and project folder:

1. **Solve Rate vs. Crime Volume by Zone**
   > The plot reveals key zones with high crime volumes and low solve rates‚Äîpotential hotspots where law enforcement resources might be prioritized.  
   ![unsolved_by_location](visuals/unsolved_by_location.png)

2. **Case Outcome by Age Group**
   > Highlights age-related patterns in case solvability, suggesting which victim age groups are more often associated with unsolved crimes.  
   ![outcome_by_age](visuals/outcome_by_age.png)

3. **Crime Type vs. Solved Rate**
   > Compares how different types of crimes correlate with resolution rates, showing which crime categories are more or less likely to be solved. 
   ![solved_by_crime_type](visuals/solved_by_crime_type.png)

4. **Confusion Matrix for Final Model**
   > Evaluates the performance of the classification model by showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

5. **Feature Importance (Random Forest Tree)**
   > Ranks the most influential features used by the Random Forest model to predict case solvability, aiding interpretability.

## What I Learned

- How to clean and standardize messy, real-world data
- The importance of thoughtful feature engineering in classification tasks
- That model performance can differ significantly based on how the target variable is defined
- How sensitive demographic and geographic data should be interpreted responsibly
- These lessons inform how I approach model design, data ethics, and real-world problem solving in future projects.

---

## Notes

- The dataset is used only for educational purposes and cannot be shared publicly. It resembles the **San Francisco Crime Dataset**, which can be referenced for similar analysis.
- The project emphasizes **methodology and interpretation** rather than conclusions about specific communities.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Future Work

- No oversampling or class weighting applied‚Äîfuture versions could use SMOTE or cost-sensitive learning  
- Dataset lacks suspect, witness, or forensic data  
- Models trained on a subset‚Äîgeneralizability may vary  
- Potential bias in crime reporting and data collection

---

## Future Improvements

I‚Äôm excited to expand this analysis using ensemble methods, interactive dashboards, and richer geospatial tools like Geopandas.
Here's a good plan or suggestions for my future self when i get the time:
- Try ensemble models like **Random Forest** or **Gradient Boosting**
- Perform **time series forecasting** on crime frequency
- Build an interactive dashboard using **Dash** or **Streamlit**
- Use **geopandas** for richer spatial visualizations
