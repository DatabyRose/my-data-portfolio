# About Me

Hi there! I'm **Rose**, a former IT Business Analyst turned aspiring Data Analyst, passionate about transforming curiosity into insight. With over 5 years of experience bridging the gap between end-users and systems—querying SQL databases, validating business rules, and translating technical findings into business action—I developed a fascination for the world of analytics after watching a colleague build a beautiful Tableau dashboard. That moment sparked a journey I’ve been on ever since.

Today, I’m diving deep into **data analytics, machine learning, and AI**, blending my problem-solving roots with emerging technical skills in **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau**. I’m currently pursuing a **Master’s in Data Analytics**, where I've explored case studies across marketing, operations, predictive modeling, and prescriptive analytics. 

My mission? To turn raw data into stories that drive smart decisions and measurable business value. I'm here to learn, create, and collaborate—**one dataset at a time**.
